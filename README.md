Hi there! 👋😊 I’m Aled and I’m an iOS Developer who has been playing with Apple devices for over a decade, and now lives in London (originally from Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿). 

## 🐙 Personal

Health is absolutely going to blow up over the next decade and it’s something I am incredibly passionate about and most of my personal projects use HealthKit such as "and Chill" and "Autooth". Keep an eye on my Twitter for updates on what’s new in the iOS Health world!

## ⚽️ Sports

I currently work at [Other Media](https://other.media) who is top of their game in sport tech and I’ve helped bring many big names come to digital life. 

## 📚 Educational

Being Welsh is a big thing for me, and I’m proud to have made some of the most popular Welsh iOS apps ever, and the first Welsh Apple Watch app! To have reached over 100,000 Welsh speaking children is 💯  (it was quite the challenge being the sole developer at Big Click 😳 and even trying my hand at writing Android apps).

## 👥 Community

I like to share my thoughts on Twitter mostly though I'm looking forward to doing another talk sometime like my one at NSLondon about the new Dark Mode support in iOS 13.
